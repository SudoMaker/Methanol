# Welcome to Methanol

Methanol turns your content folder into a static site with rEFui and MDX, file-based routing, and a fast dev server.

If you're seeing this page, that means you haven't created your `index.mdx` yet.

## Quick Start

Pages are currently read from the configured `pagesDir`:

<p><code>{ctx.site.pagesDir || 'pages/'}</code></p>

You can change this with `pagesDir` in your config or `--input` on the CLI. Create an `index.mdx` in that folder to replace this page.

## Common Folders

```
components/   # JSX/TSX components for MDX
public/       # static assets copied as-is
dist/         # production output
```
